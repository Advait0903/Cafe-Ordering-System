In this repository we have created a program for Drink Ordering System which consists of 5 different operation.<br>
(1) View Menu<br>  (2) View Your Cart<br> (3) Add beverage to cart<br>  (4) Remove beverage from cart<br>  (5) Make payment<br>

The Program is based on OOPM concepts such as Inheritance, Encapsulation and Abstraction.
